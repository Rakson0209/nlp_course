Other transport public transport is the taxi, like a car, it is so more comfortable too
The AVE or aeroplane are a good option for long trips.

Dear Sir Dimara.
I am writing about a problem in my city.
I live in Patras, a big city in Greece.
In my city, all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drawings and writing.
The vandalism in patras has increased a lot.
Unfortunately, when we say to somebody to not draw the walls, they do not hear us.
For our city, it is very bad because when some new people visit Patras they see
Patras is a very beautiful city and for her culture, and for her monuments
Why to see that?
After we have this beautiful city we have to maintain her.
In my opinion, the police should stop the Vandalisme.
If it has police all around the city, nobody will dare to do a graffiti or
I hope you will do something for that problem.
Yours faithfully,

All around the world, pupils are waiting for finishing school.
They are eager to begin a new life as adults.
But when they reach in - between periods, confused feelings cross their minds.
As a rule, after last exams, they don't know what university to choose.
What they will do in future they see, like in a fogg.
In this way, the idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is
Firstly, it'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard-
Ten or eleven years at school make them tired, in spite of pupils don't notice it
But choosing the second education is a very important step, which requires a serious attitude.
Secondly, such a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves in
Also, they would have an opportunity to be involved in volontier activity.
And thirdly, they might work for earning their own money or travel.
This year's holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and new power for future education.
One year is not a long period.
But benefits after a year off will be obvious.

Hello, Estela!
How are you? I hope you are well.
I'm writing because I tell you about my last summer holiday.
I went to Las Hurdes.
I stayed about one week at my home with my boyfriend.
I had a wedding.
While I was there, I did a lot of things.
One day, I visited Meandro del melero.
It was beautiful.
And there was a wonderful view.
The other day, I walked a lot and, the end way, we found 
The name of the waterfall was Chorrituelo.
It was spectacular.

You should visit Las Hurdes, it is a beautiful site.

English is an international language which becomes important for the modern world.
In China, English is considered to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn.
They begin to study English at an early age.
They use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day.
Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words.
That's a good phenomenon, for English, which is essential nowadays.
In addition to that, some people think English is superior to Chinese.
In my opinion, though English is for great significance, but English is after all a foreign
It is hard for people to see eye to eye.
English helps us read English original works, but Chinese help us learn a true China.
Only by characters Chinese literature can it convey its brilliance.
Learning a country's culture, especial its classic culture, the first thing is
Because of our being Chinese, why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our own culture

As far as I'm concerned, I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion.
To begin with, extracting the mineral will be harmful to our environment.
There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown.
In my childhood, I went there to spend my summer every year.
However, it will probably disappear if the developing equipment were being set up.
Next to go will be, the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely lead to air pollution
There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the
No one can deny that pollution is one of the most important things which should be prevented.
Last but not the least, the mineral extraction will turn out to be a profound influence,
To take my friend, Taylor, as an example, her homeland was over - developed and
After she grows up, she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown.
In addition, she has no memory in her childhood.
One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us.
Due to the mineral development, many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before
It seems like a sought-after chance.
Nevertheless, they do not give us any promise of the vacancy.
In addition, money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation.
In a nutshell, Based on the reasons and instances above, the disadvantages of
Therefore, I do not subscribe to this decision.
Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearing of poo.
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming.
Global warming is a serious issue, higher temperatures make the ice caps melt.
The longer we burry our heads in sand, the warmer the Earth will be.
I learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences!
I don't believe in it, especially when cars are not flying.
Even if it will have happened, there are many people who don't get a
Buses are more simple - you just buy a ticket.
And what about trains?
I saw tv about train in Japan - that is the future of public transport.
I want to see blue sky and not a stream of cars like it was in the film

Last week, my house got the second runner up.
I hope my house will get the champion in the next year.

You are like a bird.
It is the best feeling in the world.
You are very happy and sometimes I sing a song and the world is perfect.
That is everything I want to have and I'm lucky.
That's why I like the winter more than the summer.
Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for everyone who wants to come to other thoughts.
Although you are all the time in nature and when you have luck you can see animals.
It had been a very long and tiring day, but Tom felt he had achieved
Yesterday, he was on his way to home and it was getting dark.
His parents were worried and called him a couple of times.
He started walking very quickly.
Everything was dark.
She opened her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sky.
A dark sky without stars.
She got up and looked around.
She was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax
She started to take consciousness although she couldn't remember how she arrived there.
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to go from her house to this place.
The problem is the last thing she remembers is that she has been sleeping and then suddenly 
She fell asleep again, didn't she?
If she did, how she managed to walk until there in her sleep?
If she wasn't awake, why could shen't remember anything after that?
This situation was really frustrating, not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes
She started to walk to clear her mind.
She knows her way even in the dark ; she had gone to this spot a lot
The development of humankind in technology is seen everywhere.
In case of transportation technology, in this twenty-first century we have various options, like Plan
Although compared to ancient times, we are lucky enough that we have all these options.
However, if I have given the option to choose between all three, I will say plane
There are three reasons to choose this.
First reason is its speed, which compares to both other means of transportation, which can travel
It can travel thousands of miles in a couple of hours.
As a result, people can save time.
Second is safety, compared to other factors, the chances of an accident are less.
That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than by train or boat.
The third one is comfort level.
Plan is much more comfortable than both trains and boats.
In conclusion, I will say that plan will be my first choice for all of three means of
The reason behind my choice is speed, safety and comfort, which make plan my first choice.

There are adds to TV, radio, bus, streets...
In spite of this range of media, the TV continues to be the most important means of communication
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television but, is that like
On one hand, it's true that one programme or series which we see has 
There can be people tired of so much advertising content, but this is completely necessary.
There are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messages to
The TV is the most accessible way of communication and people can see the message on this way.
In addition, behind one add there are a lot of things : one industry.
In one add, there are, for example, the publicist's work,

My favourite season of the year is summer.
Why am I making this choice you clearly can ask, I love the sun and good weather.
Yes, it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay near
In spite of this, summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things life gives us
During summer I love to go to the beach and have sunbathing with my friends
I think those activities are very regenerating and they make you forget about all the warmness
Furthermore, you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this makes you feel relaxed
I really like to explore nature during summer too.
The wonderful colours of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous.

It had been a very long and tiring day, but Tom felt he had achieved
He finally, after 5 years, won a swimming competition.
It was really important for him because he had been training for 5 long years since he
He was very happy and he decided to celebrate.
He invited all his friends from the team and made a party.
Tom wanted Mel, his girlfriend, to come too.
She was really proud of him.
She was dreaming about being his wife.
She wanted to be his wife so bad.
But he didn't love her enough.
He wanted to break up with her at that party.
He was waiting 2 hours for her.
He hated that she was always late.
That was the main reason he wanted to end it up.
When Mel came she looked gorgeous.
And when he saw her, his heart started to beat faster and faster.
But time is up.
He got closer to her and told her everything.
Mel looked sadly at Tom, then said : " I'm pregnant... "
He followed and apoligized her.
He said he was drunk and didn't know what he was saying.
Then he hugged her.
He said he loved her and kissed her forehead.
He had to stay with her because of... the baby.
He couldn't just leave her carrying his baby!
No! He has never acted like this.
He knew that he had to stay with her for the rest of his life and raise the
He decided to give swimming up and started to take care of Mel.
One day Mel was feeling really bad, so Tom took her to the hospital.
He felt that something bad was going to happen.
And he was right.
Mel has lost the baby.
Tom had to make a hard decision.
His life was going to change.
Mel was crying all day and Tom couldn't stand it.
He has broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad.
He didn't care.
He thought it was her fault that she had lost their little human.
Gliding in the waves
Even if I am not very interested in training, the sport I really prefer to practice is
The sensation of being embraced by the water, feeling the body quite without weight, able
I started to practice swimming in the pool because I wasn't able to swim at all
I have been taking lessons for six months, so I improved so much my abilities.
If you are not a good swimmer, you lose the big part of pleasure of enjoying the
Practice swimming is quite hard work, especially if you need to learn basic movements, but it
I recommend that you don't have to give up before trying, because it is fairly simple
Your efforts will be prized by succeeding, and you can obtain it with practice.

Do you remember when I told you I had been helped at a concert?
It was really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoy that very much.

Report :
The aim of this report is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did
In addition, I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth it to
First, I would like to stand out from the outstanding classmates there were in class.
They were not only really clever people but also excellent co-workers.
Working collaboratively is, in fact, the most interesting way of learning any subject, even English
Second, the teachers were really good skills to teach.
They managed to encourage all of us every day.
This way, we made the most of us and never gave up improving our English level.
Third, phonetic classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy.
They helped me to pronounce words better than before starting the course.
However, in my opinion, there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher'
This way we had been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have
To wrap up the report, just say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am

In addition, I think that the settings are very realistic and the actors had a great

Is there a future for privately owned cars?
To be honest, I am not sure.
Although privately owned cars are more and more popular, and they are becoming a common asset even
Most people today realize that in our cities and on our planet there is an increasing problem of space
Carbon based fuels will not last forever.
I would say that most probably private care is not " sustainable" in the long term, and

I know that it is nice to dream of a future of technological people flying around, each
But it is not going to happen.
I guess that in our future there are no helicopters, and not even cars.
States and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative
The price for independent transport will grow dramatically.
I reckon that that will change the habits of the public.
Even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time,
Imagine this picture: the first class of this semester, students are yawning and do
Students could receive a better, more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year
Therefore, I agree with the statement that students could receive a better, more efficient education 
More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs.
To begin with, there is a general consensus, students will forget the knowledge they have learned
For example, in history class, a history teacher has to repeat teaching the history of North
It is very waste of time and not efficient.
Next to go would be, students get used to relaxing by having no study and homework on 
For example, when the semester starts, students cannot get away from the sunshine, beach, and
In the class, students will recall the joyful time they had instead paying attention to the teacher.
Last but not least, some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long break time.
For instance, learning English should be a daily education, if you have a long

I have enjoyed this sport since I was a child.
My father was a professional soccer player, so I think that I inherited this love for
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood, school or university.
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am on the playing field I forget all problems.
I like to speak with my team partners.
Together we analyze the rival team and we choose a strategy to win the match.
When I play bad, I feel nervous, but my friends give me unconditional support.
That is priceless.
I know health is very important, so if you practise this sport there is a big
So if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really like it.
If you don't like it, there are many options to practise whatever sports.
The soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes.
In this way, you have to be prepared for anything problem.
Finally, I advise you that you enjoy playing this awesome sport.

As soon as the last river ends, the southern border of Egypt is here.
The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that has been dating over 6 thousand
All historians, researchers, scientists agree with this.
And as for me, I totally support their point of view.
Egypt is a kind of river civilization among the huge desert Sahara.
All over the time, the Nile is the only source of water for Egyptians.
Furthermore, the elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding

But the Duomo is not the most important.
I am sure you'll agree that it's the Colosseum.

It's our strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people succeeded in building
That's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow
In this fast moving world, transport has become an important factor for everyday activities.
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living.
There is no point in saying public transport has no future.
Travelling through a car is a convenient mode of transport, but most of the population
There are advantages and disadvantages to using public transport.
Firstly, to discuss the benefits of public transport, it is cheap and affordable for all the
Variety of buses are released by the government in order to meet people's financial conditions.
Using public transport is a time waste and no privacy are some of the disadvantages.
Similarly, travelling by car has its own advantage and disadvantages.
Everybody can not afford a travel through car as it is costly, but to discuss the

To sum up, it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because

Furthermore, most of them are students.
They don't respect other passengers, just keep laughing and teasing each other,

Priority seats are preserved for those who need it, not only elders but also some adult
Somehow, not all of them can you identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely from their

In my opinion, the transportation in our city has nothing to criticize, expect that.
Everyone should develop awareness of public attitudes.
Television is an important part of modern culture.
We depend on television for entertainment, education, news and films.
TV has many benefits:
Firstly, it enables young people to share cultural experiences with others.
TV can act as a catalyst to get kids reading - following up on TV programs by
Television can teach kids important values and life lessons.
Educational programming can develop young children's socialization and learning skills.
News, current events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and
Documentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world.
TV can help introduce youth to classic Hollywood films and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see.
Cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people.
But television has also negative effects: First of all, children who spend a great deal of
In addition, these children receive less socialization with other children.
Television also takes away family time.
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television.

Nowadays we all hope that public transport can save the world.
When we see all these cars in our yards, when we stay in a traffic jam,
If we don't do it, one day we 'll wake up in the immortal
But, probably, this situation is only a period of development of transport.
We are told about a lot of innovations in this field.
For instance, Google reported about Googlemobile.
Maybe, robots will be able to drive more smarter than people.
If they will contact each other and use Google Map or something like that, they will be 
So people will be able to avoid traffic jams.
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile.
Some people think it might take away their independence.
But another person thinks that it is not a so bad idea, because they will be
However, there will always be people who dislike to be a driver anyway.
And people who hate public transport will always be.
The question is, which sort of people have more impact in the world, and, finally
How many languages do you speak?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language?
Or do you want to be a polyglot?
Today it is more important to learn a foreign language than before.
There are few reasons why it is important to learn a foreign language today.
First, if you are planning to travel to another country, it is absolutely useful to speak
Second, for finding a good job opportunity, the business exchange is increasing at the intranational
Third, through learning a foreign language, you do not only learn a language, at

However, the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia, are
On the one hand, there are many benefits of cycling.
Firstly, it reduces traffic jams, noise and pollution, as well as it reduce
Furthermore, it turns out to be the quickest method of transport.
On the other hand, there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads.
Statistically, cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car.
Another disadvantage is the weather.
Getting wet when it rains, having to do a lot of effort to cycle
In my point of view, cycling contributes to improving community spirit and it is possible to look
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport.
For example, people who take a car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus
And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays, due to a less frequent schedule
Also, we can drive a car to any place where public transport may not be able
When the bus is crowded, we have to stand, making us more exhausting especially for
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above, advantages of travelling by public transport
First, public transport is good for the environment compared to a private car.
As we all know, the more public transport passengers use, the less car exhausts are 
Recently, several studies have shown evidence that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and
In other words, public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering from diseases
Second, public transport saves city spaces.
As more and more people choose to live in cities, nowadays our cities become larger and more 
Correspondingly, the space for each person becomes more limited than before.

Though there are many advantages for public transport, it does not mean that public transport is the best
E.g., it offers less flexibility than cars, and is less environmentally friendly than bicycle
Therefore, it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others.
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit one.

We live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and
I think there are many reasons to learn languages.

Today, I went to my Winnie's home with Adriana in the afternoon.
We ate delicious food and played interesting games altogether.
We had a great time.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at Winnie's home.
First, we listened to some songs, such as the almost big world and the big world
After thirty minutes, we had tea.
Winnie loves eating very much, so I can easily find a lot of food at her
We had mouth-watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy
After having tea, we play hide - and seek altogether in Winnie's garden.
Adriana and I hid behind a bench and Winnie looked for us.
Suddenly, Winnie fell over a little stone.
Adriana and I immediately came to her and held her up. '
Your knee is bleeding.
Are you okay', I asked.
I was shaking like a leaf and my heart was pounding since I was worried about
I had butterflies in my stomach.'Yes, I am fine,' Winnie replied.
I felt relieved then.
Then, Adriana found a plaster and put it on Winnie's wound.
Winnie felt warm inside and smiled happily.
I felt glad today although Winnie hurt herself.
Why?
It is because our friendship is more rugged.
What an unfoggetable day!
In my opinion, the house in the future will be better.
The House of the future will be big and bright.

Big spaces will be divided into a few zones.

Hello Paul,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antaya on October.
I had a great time with people who are working as a helper for the concert
I got a lot of experience from them.
In concert time, all people can enjoy, but nobody thinks about how they are preparing
I saw so many interesting things during the preparation time.
For example, they know everything about each helper's jobs but at the same time they
I want to explain to you some interesting part from my experience.
In the concert morning we were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided to not think about
When we were arranging a concert plan, we made work sharing for all of us.
Some of them started designing the stage, some of them checking songs volume and lights.
My job was checking the songs list which singers would perform.
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers.
They always wanted to change some songs which were on the list.
At the concert time, I was really worried that something would appear suddenly.
Actually, everybody can be worried because they gave time and effort for it.
Finally, the concert started and all the lights were shining like stars.
It is difficult to explain that feeling.
When the concert finished, I felt like a bird which was flying freely.
Of course, I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing.
However, I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable projects.
I want to invite you to our next concert which will be next month if you have any
I am waiting for your email.
See you!

Do we have better television than a few decades ago?
Do we have enough choices on the screen?
Can you imagine having only two channels and not playing the whole day?
That was only 30 years ago.
An explosion of channels arrived in our houses in the eighties.
In this report we will see some characteristics of today's television.
The number of channels is gradually reducing.
In our country, one decade ago when digital TV arrived, a lot of new channels flourish
All TV companies tried to get several licences to distribute their shows.
In order to resolve some deficit budgets, today there are mainly two TV groups.
Less channels mean less choices.
Internet TV is increasing
It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment, where and with who watching this or
You just follow a suggestion made by someone.
You just click on it.
They have to reduce their budget.
Despite changing channels, we see the same news.
Big Broadcast groups are used by all of them.
It is expensive to keep journalists and cameras all around the world.
It is cheaper to buy it.
Summary
TV is dying.
It is hard to compete with the Internet.
Nowadays, only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match.
Perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit.
However, the fact is that there is a countdown on them.

Hi John,
I am looking forward to seeing you.
First of all, you should get outside of the airport terminal.
There you will see bus stations in the street.
When you get there, take the bus which has number 111.
Then ride to the bus stop " Zlin ".
There you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague.
If you choose this way, I 'll call you in the morning to tell you where
But if I were you, I would take a taxi for the underground is quite boring
Anyway, you need to get to the centre.
Finally, the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usual at this time of
That's why you don't have to take warm clothes.
I am delighted to see you soon.
Best wishes,

In my opinion, we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for
Firstly, we can discuss the type of food we want to eat.
Actually, students eat a lot fast food while they are studying at university, because they
On the other hand, we are studying architecture, maybe we should choose a special restaurant.
In conclusion, I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very important for us, because
I would like to go to Foster's Hollywood.
I love the food here and I think my classmates too.
You can find the best burgers you have ever eaten.
They are incredibily delicious.
I do not know how they make and cook them.
These burgers are my favourite food because they are amazing.
I can not say how they are because you have to taste them.
It is a flavour similar to staying in the heaven or in the paradise.
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in
You will want to come another time.
However, if you do not like burgers, you can eat whatever you want
Public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives.
More than a billion people use buses, taxis and trains etc as tourists, for work
Many even use cars.
Although travelling by car is more convenient, it is expensive.
That is why the cost of petrol, diesel and gas is quite high in most countries of the
While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in the following ways:
1. People can save the money they spend on petrol.
2.
As they have specific routes across the country, town, city and villages, it helps people to
I disagree with the statement stated above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in
The Middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day.
It is because of high taxes on goods.
So, I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as old as
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars.
Nowadays people have different views about reading books and watching movies.
Some of them think that books are more interesting than film versions.
I agree with this point of view.
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book.
Firstly, reading helps to become a well-Educated Person and gives a
That's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information.
Furthermore, books develop the imagination of the reader.
When you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in your mind.
You can imagine how heroes look like, you can imagine different views, where the action takes place
And finally, I think it's very important that you can easily take your book with
On the other hand, if you like being in company, the best way for you is
Because you can watch it with your friends.
Also, many people choose movies because they like soundtracks and special effects.
It's so exciting.
But all these factors are not important for me.
I suppose that books are better than the film version.
To sum up, I 'd like to say reading is really a great thing.
A girl was walking home one day.
She was with her mum..
She was just a young beautiful girl!
So, they were going home when the girl noticed a cute doll in a shop.
She had blond hair and she was wearing a blue dress, white gloves and black
Just like her... ''Mum I love this doll!Could you
Her mum couldn't deny to her, so she bought it.
Oh!The girl had so many special moments with her doll!!They looked so adorable together!
After some years, the girl decided that she had to move.
She was eighteen years old, she had to be indepedent.
So she took a deep breath and put her doll in the attic just like her childhood
At night she heard some creepy noises from there...
She went there and thera was the doll with a knife in her hand.'
Just because I don't have one if my gloves?But you did it again!
And then...
Next day, going to her home her mum wanted to find her daughter.
So, she went upstairs...
The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall there was a
Tennis is an individual sport.
Just you have to deal with the game.
You can choose lots of places to play.
You need a good pair of shoes, a tennis racket and some balls and
Although you should be good at playing backhand or fronthand, you can lose finally.
This sport is not just about physical power.
You should use your brain as well.
It is a combination of physical power, a technique and a mental power.
As with other sports, tennis is becoming more modern, fast and commercial.
I mean professional tennis.
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory.
Some of them practise tennis because of their parents.
It is not fair enough.
Children should play games, not just tennis, because it is fun, it develops their skills
You can start if you are grown up anyway.
It is never too late.
Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends.
Enjoy!

The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news.
You could find a variety of articles such as politics, Business and Money, sports
There are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to help individuals.
Readers are able to express their opinion freely.
They use a quality English language which avoids slang language.
As a result, it is suitable for students who learn English Language to improve their English.
On the other hand, I realised there were two disadvantages.
For example, it is not suitable for children due to official language.
Overall, The Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world.

I am convinced that using tablet computers in our everyday life is rather good.
People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag.

They believe that it is a useless thing for our generation.
Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid.
They insist on not using tablets at school.
Personally for me, I like books very much.
I do not agree with the people who think that tablets are useless.
We should use it, but we must not forget about books.

Is there any future for public transport, for travelling by car is much more convenient?
Many disagree about public transport whom are to be disappearing, though we still have to deal with
This composition will explain the two different opinions.
Firstly, the car is more convenient because there is privacy.
Also, unlike public transport such as buses and underground, you have much more comfort and speed.
There is a perception that a car can give you freedom of choice.
On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ),
There's not as many people around you... I prefer the car because you can
Although there are many positive points about private cars, they are also negative ones.

From this analysis, it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important.

Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matters and
It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment.
To further illustrate the first point above, one could hurt one's feelings by telling the truth
For example, if some woman is acquainted with wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion.
People usually tend not to tell her the truth, since it could make her feelings.
Instead of doing so, people may praise her for other things on her.
In that case, they could still make conversions without boiling her mood.

Last Friday, Michael and I were in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom.
When we were in class, suddenly Michael walked towards the door.
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he made a mistake.
Due to this, we're both called to meet the headmaster.
I couldn't understand why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had

Dear Les,
Firstly, Spain is a great place for holidays in summer.
In that time, it is always sunny and, depending on the region, it could rain.
If you want to see some beautiful scenery, you must go to Barcelona where you will be 
In Madrid, you can go to visit some museums, like the Reina Sofa
On the other hand, if you want to see some wildlife, you must visit Cabarc
If I were you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain, I would stay one
I recommend you not to take warm clothes.
I hope you enjoy your summer.

Bart Simpson is my favourite fictional character on TV.
He is the eldest son of the Simpson family.
Bart is ten years old and is a typical American child.
He has yellow skin and big eyes, he is blond and has gotspiky
Bart always wears a red T-shirt and blue shorts.
The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school, for
His parents and the school principal often punish him.
Bart is an energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and 
Although he is rather naughty, he actually has a heart of gold
In the Simpson family, all the characters are very funny.
A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree
For me, Bart is funnier than Homer, although most magazines say that Homer

I wasn't in the mood to go out anyway.
Everything suggested that I wouldn't get out of the house for quite a while.

Nowadays, public transport has become a major topic.
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries, but this idea is rejected
As a matter of fact, car ownership has increased over the last decades, reducing the

Similarly, people in countries with less income turn to these services because it is a way
To conclude, the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it.
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it, and in others where they
People need easy, fast and cheap solutions.
In general, using a car is easier than taking a train or a bus.
It's just near your house or your office.

Is the car faster than public transport?
It depends.
The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level.
Sometimes cars are faster than buses, sometimes buses are faster.
Speed trains are always faster than cars.
Speaking about money, travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport.
But, if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car, paying the insurance, etc

What about the environment and the quality of life in the cities?
Public transport is absolutely better.

Well, I would like to talk about my school life.
I'm seventeen years old and I'm an electonics'student
I wish to be a great engineer one day, so I decided to continue my studies at
I'm good at school, my marks could prove it; I have worked hard since
These days I started studying English in particular because it is the most important language in the world,
School is my life: I study about seven hours a day, especially maths and electronics
My teachers are very good at their job, so I hope to be like them one day.
The big problem in my class is the majority of my classmates : they are hopeful at school
The thing that annoys me more is that they copy all the time from me and

Puerquitour : A great experience to your mouth.
Nowadays, it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do, because
I arrived in Mexico City one month ago and I met an old friend from high school, Vic
We discovered our fascination with food and'The Puerquitour' was born.
Then a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began.
The first day started at an important date... Taco Day!
Tacontento was the place we choose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and 
Due to Puerquitour is something to share, the second day we shared it with Diana
Again, we ate tacos, but this time they were special.
The name of the place is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet there
It means that they have different tastes of tortillas -vanilla, strawberry 
That day did not finish with the tacos, after a walk in Reforma and
The third day was one of my favourites, the place is soooooo nice and the
La Papa Guapa, which is located in La Condesa, offers baked potatoes
Totally recommended!
Mar Azul Resturant, in the north of Mexico City, was the allocation for
Seafood is delicious there, my recommendations are breaded shrimp, fish fillet
Fifth day, it was time to eat more tacos, the place?...
You have to be starving to eat a molcajete by yourself,
Do not forget to ask for a litter of beer.
Almost a week in the Puerquitour.
The sixth day was to celebrate Magda's final test, a friend from high
Because we like the food, we celebrated eating in Memelas Pub.
You can't go there and don't eat memelas, that
The dessert?
Ice cream in Tepoznieves.
Because Vic was almost with a foot in the USA, we spent all day together.
Seventh day started with really nice breakfast, gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea.
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown.
The plan was to dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it,
The last day of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favourite dessert, a strawberry
I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love.
Don't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour!!
These first two chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy
This kid has been raised by his sister, a person who mistreats Pip

Moreover, he is just a regular kid with a terrible life.
Along with this, Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid.

And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild

In fact, the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences, with

" Yes, sir. "
" And you know what the? "
" Yes, sir. "
Moreover, the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters
Pip uses a rich vocabulary, using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts
The marsh pointed on the first chapter is a good example.
Regardless, the dialogues are written exactly as they were said.
The thief said " Who d'ye with? "
This is written as it is said, making it more realistic.
Notwithstanding, the way this novel is written is the protagonist.
The events are narrated in a mysterious way, telling us what happened in 
The story is narrated as it happens.

Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters.

The best places for young people in Dublin are for young people.
This report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from a different country
It is based on a survey of young people from Whitehall College as well as my

It is true that people everywhere like watching sports.
Sports start being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young
In this essay, both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective
From one point of view, top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons.
Firstly, watching the success of such athletes, teenagers start to desire to be like their
This means they will want to play sports, which is essential for their health.
Secondly, doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons, such as discipline and dealing with
The importance of working hard to achieve a goal and practicing regularly to become good at something
This is a good example for youngsters to follow.
From another perspective, sometimes professional athletes are not good role models.
Firstly, sport has become business.
Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame.
This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning
Secondly, there are those athletes who behave disgustingly.
For example, some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost.
It goes without saying that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young.
In conclusion, there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen
On balance, I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth

This festival is dedicated to the city's patron saint, and it shows traditional Galici
Another important festival in Lugo is Arde Lucus.
It is celebrated in June.
During this festivity, Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again, so
I recommend you visit Lugo in June because Arde Lucus is celebrated.
You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman life in Arde Lucus.
Lugo is an incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is

It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university,

A technological development makes people believe that in the future everything will look like in science-fiction movies
We 'll be surrounded by machines and robots.
We 'll have the possibility to choose on which planet we want to live on.
And what about houses?
Will people's homes be different or still the same?
Imagining the future, I see everything different.
The avant-garde and futuristic projects of houses will be the most desirable.
The houses will have, for example, the shape of a sphere or an i
Some of them might be turned upside down.
Sometimes they will be some kind of modern art and it will be hard to describe a shape
And what about interiors?
In our service there will be more machines and robots with artificial intelligence.
They will practically do everything : clean, cook, remind us what we have to do and
In practice, there will be no normal furniture, just machines waiting for a command.
Everything will be artificial and uncozy.
That's how I see a home of the future.

The question is whether it's better to prepare for a long time before the exam
In my personal experience, I believe that it's much better to prepare for a
It's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your
For example, one year ago, I had my final surgery exam.
I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the
The plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months.
For the hard work and perfect discipline, I was able to get a very high score
If I hadn't had such an organized plan, I would never have got such a
Another thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night.
It's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are
What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you

I had insomnia the night of my exam, it wasn't enough that I was
Ever since I have done everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed and

That will help you a lot, even if you don't get the chance to
I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam ;

In sum, I believe that setting a schedule to have a long-term preparation plan
Do you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at?
In my opinion, nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels.
Firstly, nuclear energy isn't bad for the environment.
The carbon dioxide emissions are very small.
The biggest threat is the explosion.
However, technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer.
Secondly, nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the closest to
Energy which we get from the sun and wind is still only a few percent of world energy
Thirdly, only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive.
When we have a plant, making energy from that is very cheap.
The most expensive thing in a nuclear plant is hiring qualified personnel.
Besides, we need something that can work all the time.
It doesn't stop making energy when the weather is bad, because people need a lot
If we run out of power, entire cities could plunge the chaos, and this is unacceptable.

A dog is man's best friend.
It is a well-known fact that people need to have communication with other people.
However, they are not always satisfied or taken into society.
They seek solace in someone who they would feel more comfortable with.
The best example is an animal with great qualities, a dog.
Dog's personality is one of their best qualities.
Always friendly, bubbly and in a good mood, they are great to spend time with
They feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them.
It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter.
Dog's optimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people
And that is what they are there for, to make people happy.
These hairy four-legged animals are also very protective.
One of their jobs is to watch out their human family.
So if they sense that their owner might be in danger, they immediately react by barking
The stronger the bond between the dog and their owner, the stronger the dog's reaction will
It is believed that dogs require a lot of attention, which is not true.
Dogs are really not that hard to take care of, bathing and grooming do 
These pets need a few walks a day, which could also be good for their owners
So having a dog could also remind them to live a healthier life.
In conclusion, dogs make really great pets.
Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm, but their amazing personality
So if someone really loves their pet, they would find time to pay a lot of

Does traveling broaden your mind?
In my opinion, travelling does broaden your mind.
When you visit different places, you get to see different environments, cultures, people and even different
Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways.

Well, then you don't have to worry about the parking space and you can read more
Simply, you can use the way to work as an additional time for yourself.
What else?
After work, you can go for a drink with your colleagues!
And if the ecology is important for you, just think about pollution.
Let's reflect one again: is there a future for public transport?
In my opinion : yes, there is!
Is travelling by car more convenient?
Well, it depends!
Why using the first narration?
The first narration can attract readers' attention at the beginning of the friction and makes the readers get
We can't understand what others think usually, but in this friction, the author invited us
Feeling that the main character is talking to us, as if we were all involved in
Facing the murder directly makes the horror penetrates into our hearts.
How does the author create a word of horror for his readers?
The author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene, the disordered mind and the
First, the scene that described the murder makes readersn't help themselves emerging the images
Just like the madman's plan was happening right in front of us.
Then comes to the sound, the heartbeats.
To my opinion, heartbeat is the element that pushes the whole story to the 
Every time the sound of heartbeats started arousing, something ensued.
In the first time, when the madman heard the heartbeats of the old man,
The second time when madman heard the heartbeats, he became impatient, scared
At the same time, the heartbeats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious.
Finally, I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the mad
The whole story except the end of the friction he confessed the crime, the mad
The sharp contract for the calm and the cruelty, leaves us with a strong impression that the
Shivering inside our hearts, the horror increases.
" Let's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there "
When all was set, they started their trip to the forest.
When they arrived there, they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as
"What's that? ", Max said aloud.
They ran quickly, crossed the river and they reached the place where the animal was."It
When they saw the animal, they could see that it was suffering, so they decided to free
By this decision, Max took the courage to open the trap, but the deer didn'
One of Max's friends brought water from the river to give to the deer.
Max cut a piece of his T-shirt to cure the animal.
Afterwards, the animal was better and it walked away slowly.
When the day finished, Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal
The question is: whether it is possible to be famous without journalists?
Probably not, but there are many people in show - busines or political life 
Generally, people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of
If you decide to become famous because of your scandalising private life, it would be silly to
There is a rule, probably one of the most important in public life, that says more
Most celebrities follow this rule, as it is just what they are living for.
That is why they are often able to sell information about their private life.
Real problem starts when journalists injures not the celebrity, but its friends or family.
Paparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people's children, that may have negative
How about those who do not want to be popular because of scandals?
In most cases, they are just doing their job as well as they can, leading their boring
And when paparazzi finally notice that there is nothing interesting in their life, they just leave
Summarizing, I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision,
And I hope they understand, their duty is to save their relatives.
Great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life.
As a person who loves to eat, I consider the environment, the quality of food
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called " Las Ficheras
It was suggested by two friends of mine and according to them, because of the good food and
I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to have fun and eat good Mexican food
In my opinion, the food was good, but the prices were too expensive, considering the quantity
We faced continuous problems with the order, such as dishes from another table served by us by mistake
For my luck ( or not), I met a friend of mine on the day
She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with lower prices and good service
I got curious about this place and decided to go later.
" Pistola y Corazón Taqueria " was the first Mexican restaurant
They served us " nachos " with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main
After choosing, a bottle of fresh water was served, again, for free.
We chose " tacos " of meat with guacamole sauce and it

The doorbell rang unexpectedly.
I got up and I made my way to the front door.
Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant
I was taken aback, so I called my mother, who was asleep with her boyfriend
She came down, but she did not scream.
Instead, she started crying.
The man as it turned out was my father, who had been missing for 15 years...
I did not know that he was still alive.
Mother had always told me he had died in the war.
I think she did this for my own good.
I was very bemused by the situation and did not know if I liked him or
In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room
It was very odd to see him in my home.
Now we all live together.
Although the first days were difficult, now we all get on well.
It is great to be a whole family again.
The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels.
It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations
These were groups of people doing the same work, such as carpenters.

Everybody says it's the best period in our whole life; what they do 
Adolescence could be compared to a foggy path and even when it seems
This awful fog is composed by our uncontrolled emotions.
Everything is unknown, but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things.
This could be one of the reasons why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minds.
As I said, adolescents could be very confused and if there's a thing that
The worst part is that they get angry with us!

Introduction.
The aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your centre after one
This report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool.
The gym.
The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer.
On the other hand, the gym is too small.
Every afternoon it is crowded, so it is very difficult to do exercise.
The swimming pool.
It is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length, about 20 metres.
Furthermore, it is not too deep, so it is excellent for people who want to learn how
On the other hand, the changing rooms are too far from this facility, so it is easy
Conclusions.
The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent, but the gym could be bigger.
Furthermore, you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage from the changing rooms to
The Future of Public Transport
When we imagine the future, we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains.
As technologies develop and become cheaper, more and more people buy personal cars.
A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others.
Travalling by car is also much more convenient.
Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end?
In my opinion, it is not true.
Firstly, there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy 
Students, children from large families, old people will continue to use public transportation for a long
Secondly, cars can also turn into public transport.
Science fiction often depicts the future as the world where cars are used freely.
Anyone can use the nearest car he or she sees.
Thirdly, people do not have an inborn driving skill, so even in the future children
This is also true for older people, who lose the ability to drive as they age.
In conclusion, public transportation is not likely to disappear, at least during the nearest tens
The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries
According to the chart, the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.
These ones are called " source countries ", which means that they provide a supply of health
Otherwise, the countries with the highest saliaries are country C and country D. Different
Moreover, in the first three countries, doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse
In Country D, the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses.
In conlcusion, we can say that, from the standpoint of doctors and nurses,
Boxing is a common, well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in
Boxing is a dangerous sport, there are relatively common deaths, tragic injuries and even disease
All professional boxers are at risk of being killed in his next fight.
If not killed, then more likely paralysed.
There have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few box
This is just from the elite few, and there are more from those below them.
More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned.
The sport would go underground, there would be no safety measures like gloves, a doctor,
With this going on, people taking part will be dangerous, and on the streets.
Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underound dog fights
Once boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be

There are all sorts of proposals, lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn,
Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt
Many other sports are more dangerous than boxing, motor sports and even mountaineering has
Boxers chose to box, just as racing drivers drive.

How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in'Candide '?
Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme - is the philosophy that everything and occur
Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy.
In Candide, the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at
The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme.
For example, when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army, he is 
Although this would seem to be good, it is not because of his training he kills
Voltaire shows his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss, Cand
The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to
On arrival, they see starvation and death.
Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell
Candide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be 
This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and
Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this, especially as the reason that he
Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away from l'
The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant

He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embrace
Candide's life is governed by his belief that good will prevail.
Eventually, of course, he does marry Cunégonde, but she is
She has become ugly and grew worse by the day.
This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme.
Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde, with the hope
Voltaire, in Candide, shows how the philosophy of Optimism
It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe

When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America, they

It seems to me that, for the past few centuries, Britain has always considered itself to be
Whenever necessary, she has allied herself to European powers, such as in times of war
Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent, but throughout history
In the latter half century, though, her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting
Because of her history of isolated sovereignty, it is difficult to accept being a part of 
For instance, British law is based largely on precedent, that is judge-made law
We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries, and which is widely known
There is very little European influence on our law, of course in many respects it will be
With the creation of a single Europe, new laws will have to be accepted throughout the continent
The British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law, and changes may well cause
Of course, the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe.
Will there just be one system?
The country typically is against major changes and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it
Our individual monetary system, I suppose, could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty.
It can be said that if a single Europe was created, problems may arise over its
Of course, Britain would lose her sovereignty, as would the other nations of the union.
It has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure,
To a certain extent, even if sovereignty was lost, some national personality would be preserved
The fact is that, when united, European unity would still, in essence, be divided.
There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept.
Europe as a whole faces the same problems, and therefore, if a single Europe
If the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity, they would do their
The problem facing the British, really results from their isolated past.
The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots, and the fears of losing it are very great.
Whether this would happen awaits to be seen, and will depend completely on the terms of
With 1992 now only a year away, the question of what a Single Europe will mean
I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain
This loss should not however be negative.
In fact, in political, economic and defence terms, I feel this realocation of resources
Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality, I
Throughout the world, a wind of change is apparent, but especially in Europe.
This process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolue with or without the participation
It is my belief that Britain must be involved in decision making, which will eventually decide the new
However, to be fully involved, sacrifices have to be made.
Such sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty.
In relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers, the aim is not to diminish the
As amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf, European cooperation in the field of defence can
I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force.
Whilst to an extent crippling defence costs could be cut, this would not necessarily lead to
In political terms, regardless of legislation, Britain, like the rest of Europe, is becoming increasingly
The North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries
I feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes
Politically, we are moving closer together.
Possible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen.
E.R.M. is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be

In the area of single currency, again, I feel this is inevitable.
What is important is to base this currency on the strong currencies within the EEC as opposed to
To conclude, I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to
Britain must not worry about loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent.
If we miss the boat, I think we will draw before the next boat comes.
When the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, the foundation was laid for a new
It was said that Europe would not be created quickly, but over several years.
When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum, the debate began concerning Britain
When 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market, the debate flared up again
The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992, but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant.
The former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, had not been to lead Britain into a United
There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved.
Businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992, and the single market.
Trade will be easier, with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise.
There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices, along with greater
Many Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already, with decimalization,
They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe.
Further changes are forecast for Britain, affecting day to day matters, to create a "
This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of " 1992 and all that
A single market requires one central institution to co-ordinate all movements of goods and policies.
Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels
Many people would not.
Will the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU?
It may well - but will the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and
Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national
As the date draws closer, the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase.
They must look into the future and consider possible effects.
Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will?
Perhaps as more of Britain becomes " Eurofied ", Britons will wake up and see
Britain has never been a part of Europe geographically.
We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trade.
We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone.
We have a sound democratic process which many people would not want to give up.
A fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detriment of
There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Europe in recent years that it
Now that it is a reality, and not just a probability, the question in the
Firstly, a positive approach.
Looking at things from an economic perspective, this is not a problem.
The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once, instead of twelve

Europe will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition.
To look at things on a more individual level, every member of the new Single Europe standard
A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will, in theory, result in
Simplicity is one of the Commission's key aims, with the idea that 
If this is so, they should also work better.
Ideally, there should be more equality, less crime, greater productivity and greater economic growth.
On the other hand, will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain?
It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority
Why should this matter?
Well, Britain has quite a history and, therefore, a fair number of traditions.
It is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its
Britons (especially those from older generations ) may then feel " lost " and that they
The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to

The European Community is a unique group of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the
The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe.
In particular, the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its borders; movement not only of
However, the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent
Let us look at the founding of the European Community, before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in
There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War, but only after Europe had
The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and 
This fresh start came about because of three main factors.
Firstly, was Europe's realization of her own weakness, after having lost her age
These superpowers were economically, militarily and politically stronger than the divided individual European states.
Secondly, the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided; after all, the
One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community in 1958
Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three.
One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the
This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called " integration ".
The 1970's saw progress in integration, with the introduction of community policy instruments, which
All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992,
This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty, many want unanimous voting, not
Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws, and could expect 
The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to bold
Whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is successful depends very
If a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained, the threat will subside
On Britain's roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic.
The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold-ups and traffic
To remedy this, the government has started adding a fourth lane on some stre
While the road system is being improoved, there seems to be an endless series
The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk
It might seem an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport, i

It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route!
The main disadvantage with the railways is that, as the rail service and the bus service are
If the services were integrated, there would be a bus timetable which coincided with the

My solution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services, this
To improve the rail service, trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key
The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train
The basic dilema facing the UK's rail and road transport system is
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year, consequent
The biggest worry for the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities.
Most large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport, thus decreasing
Public transport is the obvious solution to the increase in population.
For commuters who regularly travel long distances, rail transport should be made more appealing,
Motorways and other transport links are constantly being extended, widened and slowly turning the country
Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere
In conclusion, I wish to propose clean, efficient and cheap public transport for the near future.
The modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation for nearly all of the western worlds population
If every time we use our cars to travel any distance we find ourselves in a 10 mile
To illistrate my point, if every time you take a train, it
So why do we still insist on travelling on the road?
The answer most likly lies in 2 areas, firstly, the attitude of many western
This is in my opinion, a show of considerable ignorance.
I am far and away no greeny who wants to make everyone live in tipee 
The governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads just to back move, they
We all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road.
Why?
Do we, the westeren world ( 5% of the population of the world)
Just beause we cannot be bothered to get out of bed a bit e
Even if we did, then shorly so does the rest of the world.
That could have disasterous implications.
The 2nd reason, is the fact that public transport service, for example, rail, is
People stopped using trains because of the fall in standards, these people were forced onto the road
The whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of road use.
This has now been intensified with the sale of railways, to private rail companies, profit
The vital, small rail links may now be closed, and now the private companies cannot afford
The only way to stop the circle will be to break it, the only people to do this

During fights, doctors keep close to the ring and have the authority to call it

There were 2 main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery.
The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation, in
The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction

My personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser are that a large proportion

Since its introduction there has been more controversy over the national lottery.

It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound recieved
It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions, i
It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high, most of the lucky winners
In conclusion, I think that the lottery should be retained, but not in its present form.
I would also remove any american buisness interests and give the charity money to more diser
Now the lottery is in place, it would be very difficult to remove it from society.

People normally associated with politics, religion, or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of
This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical
This is especially true of the Women's Liberation Movement in America.
Since its beginnings in the late nineteenth century, Women's Liberation has been met
Some of the first radicals, Susan B. Anthony and George Sand ( although French )
At the same time, other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their
This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists, made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed
Although " radicals " such as Sand and Anthony seem docile and backward in modern
From the very beginning, the Women's Movement in America has been fighting a losing
However, I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement, but
When Women's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s, it was
Immediately, the focus was on radicals like Stein, instead of the housewife who returned
Those outside the movement could only see the differences between " normality " and Women '
This is still true twenty - five years later.
Women supporting equal pay for women and and other " liberal " causes like affirmative action are only
The good of their cause is undermined by the perception of radicals.
So what am I getting at?
Only that so-called feminists have not in and of themselves harmed the Women 
However, the popular perception of them has.
For so many years, the good that feminists have promoted for women has fallen by the way

The modern microcomputer ( PC ) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace: from the
The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories ; accounting, engineering, and
The effects of the computer have been tremendous; however, the phenomenon is a catch-22.
The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint.
The physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen.
In offices, the computer is everywhere.
From word processors to spreadsheet / database programs, computers have made office work easier and faster
Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs.
Also, almost everyone has at least one simple computer, e.g. a calculator
There are, of course, many other things computers are used for, but a lengthy list
The mental effect of computers is two - fold.
Firstly, computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do, many people do not fully
This has created a surplus of " needless " computations, figures, etc.
People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computer.
What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time.
Granted, it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that truly made
Mathematical models, theories, etc.
They are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people don't know
Due to this, errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant -
Secondly, computers have sometimes become more reliable than people.
A computer's circuits don't get tired and, if programmed 100% correctly
This supposed reliability has left many workers out of work.
The effects of this are unpredictable.
Anger, frustration, fear, and many other negative feelings have sprung up
Clearly, there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of the modern computer.
It would be practically impossible to throw the computer away or never use it again.
Yet there are practical solutions.
Better mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer other than a simple calculator.
Also, curtailing some theoretical programming could eliminate alarming predictions or erroneous
The key is probably in the classroom.
People should learn more about the ramifications about what they are doing.
( This probably would require understanding of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science.)
In either case, if computers are good or bad, it would be difficult to dispute their

Never before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill.
Never before had one object of such a small size been able to take so many lives
For this reason, it is considered the most awe-inspiring and dangerous
Unfortunately, with each progressive day, the world's need for this dangerous energy increases.
Because it does not only have the capacity to kill, but also have the capacity to kill,
But also the capability to supply and energize the world.
The drawback is the danger.
In utilizing this power in plants and factories, we run the risk of contaminating our

The idea I feel that has most significantly changed people's lives in the 20th century
Today, people have become aware of the importance of the environment to our future.
People are concerned about nuclear weapons.
We realize that countries that have many weapons have the power to destroy the world.
Also related to this topic is nuclear waste.
Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans; it also kills animals and plants.
We are now fighting for acts to clean up our lakes and rivers.
Companies are no longer able to freely dump their waste / o being heavily fined
People have also become concerned about nature.
We used to assume our natural resources were never ending.
Now, though, we realize what we use, needs to be replaced.
For example, deforestation is a very big issue, many groups have formed to
We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively.
Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling.

Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy, it also is beneficial to their
Another important issue is that of conserving energy.
In the past, once again, we assumed our energy was never ending.
Now though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they're not in their
We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saving money.
We have also become more significant in our animal life.
We are no longer able to kill animals freely.
We do still raise some for food but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilities
One realizes that animals have rights too.
In conclusion, the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one.
We are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more precautions.
The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with.
But we are heading in the right direction and hopeful by the 21st century we will have

A complete break has been forged in the way food is prepared.
At the dawn of time, cave men cooked animal flesh over open fires.
As history progressed, spits and barbeques emerged.
Technology saw the advent of the wood stove, and later ones fueled by coal.
Modern times saw gas and electric ranges as staples.
All these things had one thing in common : FIRE.
